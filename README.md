# xps-9570-arch-docs

This is a repository where I document all kinds of stuff about my Dell xps 9570 setup.\
#### Tree:
 - [Arch config](https://github.com/davidschlegel/xps-9570-arch-docs/blob/master/Arch_config.txt)\
Here, I add stuff that I change to my system, so that I can look up what I have done.
So it basically consists of shell commands with some comments.
So, be aware, that it is not all well documented, always look things up at the archwiki first.
 - [Arch installation](https://github.com/davidschlegel/xps-9570-arch-docs/blob/master/Arch_installation_procedure.txt) \
My installation proceedure. Most of it was taken by [grobgl](https://github.com/grobgl/arch-linux-setup)
